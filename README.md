In this article, weâ€™ll see how to load data from different data sources in the WPF Charts control. 

There are three essential properties of the WPF Charts to configure the data:

[ItemsSource](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_ItemsSource): Collects the data points used to generate the chart.

[XBindingPath](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_XBindingPath): A bindable property that gets the property path of x-axis data in ItemsSource to render the chart series.

[YBindingPath](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.XyDataSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_XyDataSeries_YBindingPath): A bindable property that gets the property path of y-axis data in ItemsSource to render the chart series.
